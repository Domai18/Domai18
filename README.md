## About Me 📊

#### 🚀 My name is Derrick Omai. Originally from Kenya, now studying Data Analytics in the United States. 

#### 🌱 I’m fascinated by how data travels across borders, how societies make decisions, and how technology can expand access and opportunity. I’ve worked on projects ranging from happiness modeling to sports analytics and statistical research, and I am equipping myself with the tools and skills to build toward a future where AI and data can be used to improve civic participation and economic development globally.

#### 💻 I enjoy learning new tools, exploring questions through data, and collaborating on meaningful work.
