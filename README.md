## About Me 📊

My name is Derrick Omai. Originally from Kenya, now studying Data Analytics in the United States. 🚀  

I’m fascinated by how data travels across borders, how societies make decisions, and how technology can expand access and opportunity.  🌱 

I’ve worked on projects ranging from happiness modeling to sports analytics and statistical research, and I am equipping myself with the tools and skills to build toward a future where AI and data can be used to improve civic participation and economic development globally.

I enjoy learning new tools, exploring questions through data, and collaborating on meaningful work.  💻
